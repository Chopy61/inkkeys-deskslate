# 3d models

All STLs are based on the same [Blender](https://www.blender.org/){:target="_blank"} file I used to create the animations in the video. The model in the blend file is based on a 3d model exported from KiCad, which I converted using FreeCAD. So, most of the components are from the KiCad libraries while I got the Pro Micro from the [Spark Fun KiCad Libraries](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-KiCad-Libraries){:target="_blank"} combined with a [3d model by Andrew Whitham](https://grabcad.com/library/arduino-pro-micro-1){:target="_blank"} for the Pro Micro.
