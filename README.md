In contrast to most of my other projects, I decided to put this into its own repository as it is slightly more complex and I am hoping for community contributions.

If you have pull-requests, bug reports or want to contribute new case designs, please do not hesitate to open an issue. For generic discussions, "show and tell" and if you are looking for support for something that is not a problem in the code here, I would recommend [r/thereoughtabe on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/thereoughtabe/).
